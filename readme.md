# Beaver

Beaver is a modeling editor for KAOS models. 

The editor has been designed to be modular and easy to extend for research purposes. Sometimes, level of indirection makes the software hard to read and understand. But this is necessary for low coupling between components.

If you have any question regarding this software, do not hesitate to contact the author.
